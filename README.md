# Yorozuya's Hub

This is an e-commerce app for Yorozuya in development..<br />
Look forward to it....

# Project Details (Miscellaneous things and stuffs)
* 5th November 2021 <br />
The date might change if our TA is in a good mood (I hope he enters a good mood) <br />

* Overall Progress : 20% complete... <br />
(I'll never meet the deadline at this rate 🤦🏾‍♂️. Let's just hope for the best 🙂) </br>

Sooo.. I'll be using an API called FakeStore API to generate my store data. Pretty basic stuff.<br />
Gotta thank Mushud for that video on the Weather API thingy. Really helpful 👌🏾 <br />

# P.S.
Oh, also for anyone curious about the name I used for my store (*__Yorozuya__*), I got it from an anime I really enjoy <br />
It's called *__Gintama__*. You should check it out if you watch anime like I do. It's really good <br/><br/>

Here is the IMDB link, just to give you a small description about it:<br/>
